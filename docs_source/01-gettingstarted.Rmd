# Getting started

## System requirements

**Osprey** requires [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and
has been tested on version 2017a and newer (2019a and newer is required for the GUI). The following toolboxes are
required for full functionality:

  - Optimization
  - Statistics and Machine Learning

```{block2, note-license, type='rmdnote'}
You may need to ask your system administrator for a separate license for missing toolboxes.
```

You can check your current MATLAB version and the available toolboxes with the following command at the MATLAB prompt:

```octave
>> ver
```

```octave

The available toolboxes (including SPM) are checked at the initial call of the Osprey GUI, and missing toolboxes are reported back to the user.

## Installing Osprey

Get the latest **Osprey** code from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/schorschinho/osprey):

  - Clone the repository, or download and extract the contents of the .ZIP file to a directory on your drive.

    ```{r installOsprey, fig.cap='Cloning Osprey from GitHub.', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("img/02-installing-osprey-download-clone.png")
    ``` 
    
  - Add the entire `osprey` directory (with subfolders) to your MATLAB path.
  - Make sure to regularly check the repository for updates, as we frequently commit new features, bug fixes, and improved functions.

To perform voxel co-registration and tissue segmentation, download **SPM12** [from the University College London website](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/). You will need to provide the SPM team with some information before you can access the download link.

  - Extract the downloaded archive so that the `spm12` folder is on the same directory level as the `osprey` folder:
  
 ```{r spmFolder, fig.cap='Make sure that the SPM12 and Osprey folders are in the same directory.', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("img/02-installing-osprey-spm-folder.png")
 ``` 

  - Add the `spm12` folder to your MATLAB path, but **without** subfolders.
  
```{block2, noteSPMsub, type='rmdwarning'}
 - during testing, we have found that adding SPM subfolders to the MATLAB path can cause functions to fail. Add the top-level directory to your path, but not subfolders.
```

If you want to use the **Osprey** Graphical User Interface (GUI), please download the following toolboxes from the MATLAB File Exchange:

  - [GUI Layout Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox)
    (David Sampson)

  - [Widget Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/66235-widgets-toolbox)
    (Robin Jackey)

Download both toolboxes in the MATLAB toolbox format (.mltbx). You can double-click to install. MATLAB will automatically add the toolboxes to its path.

## How to organize your raw data

Raw MRS data come in an overwhelming variety of formats, each producing
different numbers of files. **Osprey** does not make a lot of assumptions with regard to your folder structure, since you specify the exact location for each file in a job file prior to each analysis. It is **highly** recommended, however, that you store different acquisitions in separate folders. Organizing your raw data in a consistent and meaningful way will save you a lot of time and nerves.

To ensure optimal functioning of **Osprey**, we suggest adapting the folder
hierarchy [proposed by the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)
initiative](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/wiki/The-BIDS-folder-hierarchy):

> There are four main levels of the folder hierarchy, these are:
```
project/
└── subject
    └── session
        └── acquisition
```
> With the exception of the top-level `project` folder, all sub-folders have a specific structure to their name (described below). Here's an example of how this hierarchy looks:
```
myProject/
└── sub-01
    └── ses-01
        └── anat
```

An example adaptation of this hierarchy for Philips MRS data could look like this:

```
myProject/
├── sub-01
│   └── ses-01
│       ├── anat
│       │   └── sub-01_T1w.nii
│       └── mrs
│           ├── sub-01_mega-press_act
│           │   ├── sub-01_mega-press_act.sdat
│           │   └── sub-01_mega-press_act.spar
│           ├── sub-01_mega-press_ref
│           │   ├── sub-01_mega-press_ref.sdat
│           │   └── sub-01_mega-press_ref.spar
│           └── sub-01_press-water
│               ├── sub-01_press-water_act.sdat
│               └── sub-01_press-water_act.spar
├── sub-02
│   └── ses-01
│       ├── anat
│       │   └── sub-02_T1w.nii
│       └── mrs
│           ├── sub-02_mega-press_act
│           │   ├── sub-02_mega-press_act.sdat
│           │   └── sub-02_mega-press_act.spar
│           ├── sub-02_mega-press_ref
│           │   ├── sub-02_mega-press_ref.sdat
│           │   └── sub-02_mega-press_ref.spar
│           └── sub-02_press-water
│               ├── sub-02_press-water_act.sdat
│               └── sub-02_press-water_act.spar
...
...
```

While adhering to the BIDS standard is strongly recommended, it is by no means
binding for most file formats. You can, for example, keep Siemens TWIX files
(`.dat`) all in the same folder, and **Osprey** will be able to handle them, if
you define their paths in the job file accordingly.

```{block2, noteBIDSRDA, type='rmdwarning'}
There is one exception: For data stored in single-average DICOM (`*.IMA`, `*.DCM`) or single-average Siemens RDA format, it is **absolutely necessary** to keep every scan in a separate folder.
```
